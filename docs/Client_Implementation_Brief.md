# Product API – Implementation Brief (Client-Facing)

## 1. Executive Summary
- We delivered a secure, scalable REST API for managing Products and Items.
- Stack: .NET 8, ASP.NET Core Web API, EF Core (SQL Server), JWT auth with refresh tokens, Swagger, Serilog, Docker.
- Outcome: CRUD for Products/Items, pagination, validation, error handling, logging, API docs, and token-based security.

## 2. Architecture Overview (High-Level)
- Layers:
  - Domain: Entities and domain exceptions
  - Application: Services, DTOs, validators, mapping
  - Infrastructure: EF Core DbContext, repositories, identity (JWT + refresh)
  - API: Controllers, middleware, versioning, Swagger
- Rationale: Clean separation enables maintainability, testing, and scalability.

## 3. Implementation Steps (What we did and Why)
1) Project setup and dependencies
   - Added EF Core, AutoMapper, FluentValidation, Swagger, Serilog, API Versioning, JWT.
   - Why: Standard, proven libraries to accelerate delivery and quality.
2) Domain modeling
   - Implemented `Product` and `Item` with relationship and audit fields.
   - Why: Mirrors business data; supports integrity and reporting.
3) Data access (EF Core + Repositories)
   - `ApplicationDbContext`, generic and specific repositories (paging, eager loads).
   - Why: Encapsulates persistence; simplifies testing and future changes.
4) Application services
   - `ProductService`, `ItemService` for business orchestration and mapping.
   - Why: Keep controllers thin; centralize rules and policies.
5) Validation and mapping
   - FluentValidation for request DTOs; AutoMapper profiles for DTO<->entity.
   - Why: Reliable input quality; stable external contracts.
6) API controllers + versioning
   - `ProductsController`, `ItemsController` with RESTful endpoints; v1 API.
   - Why: Predictable resource design; forward-compatible.
7) Error handling middleware
   - Consistent JSON errors with trace IDs.
   - Why: Professional client experience; easy troubleshooting.
8) Logging
   - Serilog to console and rolling files under `Logs/`.
   - Why: Operational visibility and faster diagnosis.
9) Security – JWT with refresh tokens
   - `AuthController` (login/refresh/revoke), `[Authorize]` on write endpoints; reads open.
   - Why: Standards-based security with good UX via refresh.
10) Performance
   - Pagination, `AsNoTracking` for reads, index on product name, response compression, async I/O.
   - Why: Handles larger datasets efficiently.
11) Docs & tests
   - Swagger/OpenAPI; tests for validators and API behaviors.
   - Why: Self-serve docs; confidence via automated checks.
12) Containerization
   - Dockerfile and docker-compose with SQL Server service.
   - Why: Reproducible environment and simplified deployment.

## 4. Authentication Flow (High-Level)
- Login: Client posts credentials → receives Access Token (short-lived) + Refresh Token (longer-lived).
- Use: Client sends `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>` to call protected endpoints.
- Refresh: Client posts refresh token to obtain a new access token (rotation is applied).
- Revoke: Client can revoke a refresh token (logout/invalidate).

## 5. API Surface (Key Endpoints)
- Auth: `POST /api/v1/auth/login`, `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh`, `POST /api/v1/auth/revoke`
- Products: `GET /api/v1/products`, `GET /api/v1/products/{id}`, `POST/PUT/DELETE /api/v1/products{/{id}}`
- Items: `GET /api/v1/items/{id}`, `GET /api/v1/items/product/{productId}`, `POST/PUT/DELETE /api/v1/items{/{id}}`

## 6. Environment & URLs (Default Dev)
- API: `http://localhost:5190`
- Swagger: `http://localhost:5190/swagger`
- Demo users (dev only): `admin` / `Password123!`, `user` / `Password123!`

## 7. Pros (Business Value)
- Maintainable architecture (faster change, lower risk)
- Secure write operations with JWT + refresh
- Clear, versioned REST API with automated docs
- Strong validation and consistent error handling
- Production-friendly logging and containerization
- Good performance practices (pagination, compression, async)

## 8. Cons / Limitations
- Demo users in config (not a real user store)
- In-memory refresh tokens (non-persistent; single-instance)
- No role policies enforced yet (roles present but not used)
- Limited test coverage on complex business rules
- No health checks, metrics or distributed tracing yet

## 9. Recommended Improvements (Next Iterations)
- Identity & Authorization
  - Integrate ASP.NET Core Identity or external IdP (Azure AD, Auth0)
  - Implement role policies (e.g., Admin-only destructive actions)
- Token Management
  - Persist refresh tokens (DB/Redis), add IP/device binding and rotation auditing
- Observability
  - Add health checks (`/health`), OpenTelemetry tracing/metrics, dashboards
- Quality & Stability
  - Expand unit/integration tests and CI/CD with quality gates
  - Add input/output schemas in Swagger with examples and error models
- Performance
  - Caching for hot reads, EF compiled queries, SQL indexes review
- Security Hardening
  - Strong secret management (Key Vault/Secrets), security headers (CSP), rate limiting
- Operations
  - Production Docker Compose or Helm charts, environment-specific configs, blue/green deploys

## 10. Demo Script (5–7 minutes)
1) Open Swagger; show endpoints and versioning
2) Login (auth/login) → copy access token
3) Create product (authorized) → show response
4) List products (paged) → show metadata
5) Create item for product → show linkage
6) Refresh token → show rotation
7) Show logs folder entries and error handling JSON example
